This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# ChronoVue

ChronoVue is an **AI-powered future timeline platform**. The goal of this project is to help people **plan, track, and visualize their life, career, or learning goals** in a simple but powerful way.

Unlike basic to-do lists or task managers, ChronoVue focuses on the **bigger picture**. It lets users see their journey as a timeline — with milestones, reflections, and AI insights — so they can stay motivated and on track.

This repository contains the **first working version** of ChronoVue, with **Authentication and Onboarding completed**. More advanced features will be added step by step.

---

## 🌟 What is ChronoVue?

ChronoVue is like your **personal roadmap builder**. Imagine being able to:

* Create a **timeline** of your goals (example: finishing B.Tech, preparing for interviews, getting your first job).
* Add **milestones** (exams, projects, certifications, personal goals).
* Write **reflections or journals** about your progress.
* Get **AI-powered insights** that guide you on what to improve or learn next.
* Connect with **mentors** who have already achieved what you’re working towards.
* Share or collaborate with a **community** of like-minded learners.

That’s the bigger vision of ChronoVue.

---

## ✅ Current Features

Right now, the project includes:

* **User Authentication** → Users can sign up, log in, and securely access their dashboard.
* **Onboarding Flow** → After registration, new users go through a simple setup where they add their name, basic info, and preferences.

This sets up the foundation for everything else.

---

## 🔮 Planned Features (coming soon)

### 1. **Timeline Creation**

* Users can create their own personal or career timeline.
* Add **milestones** like “Finish Semester 6”, “Start Internship”, “Build Portfolio Website”.
* Organize them by **date, category, or priority**.
* The dashboard will show these milestones in a **beautiful interactive timeline view**.

---

### 2. **AI Insights**

* AI looks at your timeline and milestones to give **smart suggestions**.
* Example: If your timeline has “Full Stack Internship”, AI might suggest “Practice React projects” or “Revise SQL basics”.
* AI can also **predict realistic timelines** by comparing with other users’ data (future feature).

---

### 3. **Journal & Reflection Logs**

* Users can write **daily or weekly reflections** (like a personal log).
* Example: “This week I finished my DSA course, but I struggled with graphs.”
* AI reads your reflection and gives **feedback or encouragement**.
* Over time, you can **look back at your growth**.

---

### 4. **Mentorship Matching**

* AI matches you with mentors who have completed similar timelines.
* Example: If you’re preparing for a software job, it pairs you with seniors or professionals who already did it.
* Makes the journey more **human and guided**.

---

### 5. **Community Space**

* A place to **share timelines, progress, and reflections** with others.
* Discussion boards for topics like career prep, coding challenges, or productivity.
* Optional: collaborate on **shared timelines** with friends.

---

### 6. **Resource Hub**

* Curated resources (articles, courses, videos) recommended by AI.
* Example: If your timeline has “Learn Machine Learning”, AI may suggest a top course or roadmap.
* Saves time searching for what to learn next.

---

### 7. **Profile & Settings**

* Users can customize their profile with skills, goals, and achievements.
* Privacy settings: choose what to keep private vs. share with the community.
* Manage account details and notification preferences.

---

### 8. **Premium (Future Scope)**

* Extra AI-powered features like **career predictions**, **detailed analytics**, and **personalized mentoring sessions** could be part of a future premium version.
