# ChronoVue

ChronoVue is an **AI-powered future timeline platform**. The goal of this project is to help people **plan, track, and visualize their life, career, or learning goals** in a simple but powerful way.

Unlike basic to-do lists or task managers, ChronoVue focuses on the **bigger picture**. It lets users see their journey as a timeline — with milestones, reflections, and AI insights — so they can stay motivated and on track.

This repository contains the **first working version** of ChronoVue, with **Authentication and Onboarding completed**. More advanced features will be added step by step.

## 🌟 What is ChronoVue?

ChronoVue is like your **personal roadmap builder**. Imagine being able to:

* Create a **timeline** of your goals (example: finishing B.Tech, preparing for interviews, getting your first job).
* Add **milestones** (exams, projects, certifications, personal goals).
* Write **reflections or journals** about your progress.
* Get **AI-powered insights** that guide you on what to improve or learn next.
* Connect with **mentors** who have already achieved what you’re working towards.
* Share or collaborate with a **community** of like-minded learners.

That’s the bigger vision of ChronoVue.
